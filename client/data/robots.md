Yes, you two are the best of friends.

He is clothed in a loose-fitting red tunic, and he shoots you a puckish, friendly look. You sit down beside him to watch the sunset together. 

"I hope I didn't keep you waiting," you say. 

"Actually, I'm still waiting," he says with a slight smile. "For you to build me." 

"I can do that?" you say.

"I don't understand," you say. 

"Just remember that no great thing happens without sacrifice," he says. "And, I'm sorry."
